## 1. What is DevOps?
=> DevOps is a software development practice that aims to improve collaboration between devlopers and operations teams. The goal is to deliver software faster and more reliable.

## 2. What does DevOps engineers actually do?
=> DevOps simplify software development and deployment by automating tasks through different practices like, <br>
  - CICD using __GitLab, GitHub and Jenkins__ <br>
  - Creating and managng infrastructure programmatically using __Terraform__ or __Ansible.__ <br>
  - Monitoring systems or applications through __Prometheus__ or __Grafana.__ <br>
  - Hosting applications on __Cloud__ or __On-premise.__ <br>
And many other practices that ensures reliablity, security, and performance of your software applications. <br>

In Short the role of DevOps engineers is to deploy, troubleshoot, and make sure your applications or system are up and working.


## 3. Benefits of DevOps?
__1. increase productivity:__
<br> __2. Faster delivery:__
<br> __3. Better collaboration:__
<br> __4. Greater automation:__ DevOps teams can use automation to speed up tasks like testing, code deployment, and incident management.
<br> __5. Easier maintenance:__ DevOps can make it easier to maintain exixting deployment.
<br> __6. Decreases load:__

=> DevOps Lifecycle is a methodology software development teams use to bring products to market more quickly and efficiently. It's a way of managing the entire software lifecycle from development through release, focusing on collaboration between developers and IT operations professionals. Constant software creation, development, verification, release, and management are part of the DevOps lifecycle.

<br> **1. Plan:** Professional determine the commercial need and gather end-user opinions through this 
<br> **2. Code:** Developers will write code in accordance with the specifications outlined in the planning phase and will ensure that the code is created with the project’s operations in mind. DevOps tools and extexnsion like Git that assist them in preventing safety problems and bad coding standards.
<br> **3. Build:** After programmers have completed their tasks, they use tools suc as Maven and Gradle to submit the code to the common code source.
<br> **4. Test:** To assure software integrity, the product is first delivered to the test platform to execute various sorts of screening such as user acceptability testing, safety testing, integration checking, speed testing, and so on, utilizing tools such as JUnit, Selenium, etc. 
<br> **5. Release:** At this point, the build is prepared to be deployed in the operational environment. The DevOps department prepares updates or sends several versions to production when the build satisfies all checks based on the organizational demands.
<br> **6. Deploy:** At this point, Infrastructure-as-Code assists in creating the operational infrastructure and subsequently publishes the build using various DevOps lifecycle tools.
<br> **7. Operate:** This version is now convenient for users to utilize. With tools including Chef, the management department take care of server configuration and deployment at this point.
<br> **8. Monitor:** The DevOps workflow is observed at this level depending on data gathered from consumer behavior, application efficiency, and other sources. The ability to observe the complete surroundings aids teams in identifying bottlenecks affecting the production and operations teams' performance times
<br>

## 5. DevOps Phases:

</div>

<br>**1. Continious Development (Planning & Coding):** This phase involves the planning and coding of the software. The vision of the project is decided during the planning phase. And the developers begin developing the code for the application. There are no DevOps tools that are required for planning, but there are several tools for maintaining the code.
<br>**2. Continious Integration:** Continuous integration is the most important stage of the DevOps lifecycle. At this phase, updated code or new functionality and features are developed and incorporated into the existing code. In addition, defects are spotted and recognized in the code at each level of unit testing during this phase, and the source code is updated accordingly. This stage transforms integration into a continuous process in which code is tested before each commit. In addition, the necessary tests are planned during this period.
<br>**3. Continious Testing:** 
<br>**4. Continious Deployment:**
<br>**5. Continious Feedback:**
<br>**6. Continious Monitoring:**
<br>**7. Continious Operations:**


## Q) difference between monolithic architecture and microlithic architecture?
=>
* __Monolithic Architecture:-__
Monolitic arcitecture is a traditional approach to designing software where an entire application is built as one large system and is usually one code-base. In this architecture, all the different components of the application, such as the user interface, business logic, and data access layer, are tightly integrated and deployed together. It extremely difficult to change technology or language or framework because everything is tightly coupled and depend on each other.

* __Microlithic/Microservices Architecture:-__
Microservices architecture is built as small independent module based on business functionality. In microservices application, each project and services are independent from each other at the code level. Therefore it is easy to  configure and deploy completely and also easy to scale based on demand. <br>
  - Each service is responsible for a single functionality or feature of the application and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. <br>
  - The Microservice architecture has a significant impact on the relationship between the application and the database. <br>
  - Instead of sharing a single database with other microservices, each microservice has its own database. It often results in duplication of some data, but having a database per microservice is essential if you want to benefit from this architecture, as it ensures loose coupling.

## Q) Difference between Statefull and Stateless application?
=>
__Stateful applications:-__
Stateful applications save session/client data on the server, which can provide faster processing and imoroved performance. However, they require more memory and processing power to maintain session information, and can be more difficult to develop and maintain.<br>
__For example,__ <br>
- Online shoping carts:- Kepp track of what you put in them. <br>
- Banking systems:- Keep track of account information.<br>
- Social media sites: Display information based on a user's preferences.
<br>

__Stateless applications:-__
Stateless applications don't save session data on the server, and instead rely on external entities like databases or cache to manage state. This can make them simpler to develop and maintain, and they often use fewer resources.<br>
__For example,__ <br>
- File Transfer applications
- Downloading

## Q) Difference between Agile and Waterfall Model?
=>
__Agile Model:-__ This is flexible, iterative and incremental modle emphasizes collaboration, continuous feedback, and adaptation to changing requirements. In Agile model teams may work on different phases of a project simultaneously, and they focus on delivering small, functional segments quickly. Agile teams also tend to use minimal documentation and informal communication.

<div>
  <img width=400 height=250 src="https://static.javatpoint.com/difference/images/agile-vs-waterfall-model.png">
</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    Agile focuses on customer feedback, colaboration, small and rapid releases.
  </li>
  <li>
    Its purpose is to manage complex projects.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Agile produces better application suites with the desired requirements. Moreever, it can quickly adapt according to the canges made on time during the project life.
  </li>
  <li>
    It has a small team size. Therefore, fewer people work on it so that they can move faster.
  </li>
  <li>
    The agile model is not a suitable model for small projects. The expenses of developing the small projects using agile are more than compared to other models.
  </li>
  <li>
    In agile methodology, the interaction of customers is very high, as after each iteration an incremental model is deployed to customers.
  </li>
</ul>


__Waterfall Model:-__ This rigid, sequential model focuses on thorough planning and execution of project phases in order, from requirements gathering to deployment. Waterfall teams must complete each phase before moving on to the next, and they rely heavily on detailed documentation and formal communication.

<div>
  <img width=400 height=250 src="https://static.javatpoint.com/difference/images/agile-vs-waterfall-model2.png">
</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    Waterfall model is not an ideal model to develop a large scale project size.
  </li>
  <li>
    The requirements in the waterfall model should be clear cut at the beginning time; otherwise, it may lead to a less effective method.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the waterfall model, it is hard to move back in order to make changes in the previous phase.
  </li>
  <li>
    The testing process in the waterfall model starts after the completion of development. So, there is a high chance of bugs to be found later in the project development.
  </li>
</ul>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Customer interaction </td>
    <td> In Agile model, there is a high customer interaction. It is because, after every iteration, an incremental version is deployed to the customer. It requires continious feedback and collaboration. </td>
